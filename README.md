* Validation checks for missing, inconsistent, or duplicate records
* Standardization of formats (dates, numeric values, categories)
* Ensuring referential integrity across tables

#### **3. Integration**

* ETL workflows to extract, clean, and load data into SQL Server
* Transformation logic for harmonized and analysis-ready data
* Use of staging, integration, and DWH layers

#### **4. Scope**

* Creation of fact and dimension tables
* Star schema modeling
* Historical and current data handling
* Query optimization and indexing for faster analytics

#### **5. Documentation**

# 🙋 About Me

Hi! I’m **Sai Bhavana** — part data engineer, part analyst, part storyteller.
I turn raw data into meaningful narratives, build systems that make information flow smoothly, and uncover insights that help businesses see what they couldn’t before.

I’m driven by curiosity:
✨ *Why is this happening?*
✨ *What patterns are hiding beneath the surface?*
✨ *How can we turn this data into something powerful?*

My work sits at the intersection of logic and creativity — designing data warehouses, engineering clean pipelines, crafting thoughtful SQL solutions, and translating complex datasets into insights that spark smarter decisions.

### 🌟 What I Love Doing

* Designing modern data warehouses that feel clean, scalable, and intuitive
* Building ETL workflows that transform chaos into clarity
* Diving deep into SQL to decode patterns in customer behavior and sales trends
* Crafting dashboards & visual stories that make insights impossible to ignore
* Solving problems that don’t have obvious answers

### 🚀 What Inspires Me

I’m fascinated by how data can reshape the way teams think, work, and grow.
Give me a dataset and a challenge — and I’ll gladly lose track of time exploring it.

### 🤝 Let’s Connect

Whether you want to collaborate, brainstorm, learn, or build something impactful — I’d love to connect. Data is more fun when shared!



Feel free to connect with me on my learning journey and future projects!
